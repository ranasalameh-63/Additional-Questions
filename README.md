# Fruit Array and Function Tasks 🍎🍌🍓

## Introduction 📚
This project involves two main tasks:
1. Dynamically adding images of fruits to an HTML page using JavaScript.
2. Writing a function to find the index of a given element in an array.

## Task 1: Adding Fruit Images to HTML 🍏📸

### Problem:
Given an array of 5 different fruits, we need to add images for each fruit to an unordered list (`<ul>`) and display them on the HTML page.

### Solution:
We will:
- Create an array containing fruit names.
- Use JavaScript DOM manipulation to add image elements for each fruit to the HTML `<ul>`.
- Apply some CSS to make the images and the list look nice.
